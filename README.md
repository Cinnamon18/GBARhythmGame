# Cinnamon's GBA Rhythm Game

A rhythm game I made for the CS 2110 GBA project.

Please note I rebound the default mednafen controls. Here are the relevant keybinds:
```
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|A|S|D|F| |J|K|L|;|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
  left      right
```
When playing a song, you press there are 8 possible places a note can fall. The leftmost note spot corresponds to A, the second leftmost to S, and so on.

On the song select screen, press the left keys to scroll left, and the right keys to scroll right. Pretty simple! Space bar is the "confirm" or "enter" button. Select is bound to its default key, "backspace".
